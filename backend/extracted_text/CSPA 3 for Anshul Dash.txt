MIDAS FINANCIAL, INC.
COMMON STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT
This Common Stock Purchase Agreement (this “
Agreement
”) is made as of the last date set forth on the
signature pages hereto by and between 
Midas Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “
Company
”), and Anshul
Dash (“
Purchaser
”).
1
. 
​Sale of Stock​
.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and effective 1/24/2024 (the
“
Purchase Date
”), the Company will issue and sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from the
Company, 270,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (the “
Shares
”) at a purchase price of $0.00001 per
share for a total purchase price of $2.70 (the “
Aggregate Purchase Price
”). On the Purchase Date, Purchaser
will deliver the Aggregate Purchase Price to the Company and the Company will enter the Shares in
Purchaser’s name as of such date in the books and records of the Company or, if applicable, a duly authorized
transfer agent of the Company. The Company will deliver to Purchaser, upon request, a notice of issuance with
respect to the Shares as soon as practicable following such date. As used elsewhere herein, the term “
Shares
”
refers to all of the Shares purchased hereunder and all securities received in connection with the Shares
pursuant to stock dividends or splits, all securities received in replacement of the Shares in a recapitalization,
merger, reorganization, exchange or the like, and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property
to which Purchaser is entitled by reason of Purchaser’s ownership of the Shares.

. 
​Consideration​
.
 
As consideration for the mutual promises and covenants set forth in this Agreement,
Purchaser will deliver the Aggregate Purchase Price to the Company by (select one): 
☑
 
an assignment of certain assets, subject to the terms of the Assignment of IP and Other Assets in the
form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit B, which shall only apply if the box to the left is checked, or
☐
 
a cash payment (via check, wire transfer, ACH transfer or other such means as is acceptable to the
Company).
3
. 
​Limitations on Transfer​
.
 
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Shares purchased under this
Agreement 
are subject to (i) the terms and conditions that apply to the Company’s Common Stock including
(without 
limitation) certain transfer restrictions set forth below, as may be in effect at the time of any proposed
transfer, as well as the restriction on transfer contained in the Company’s Bylaws (the “
Transfer Restrictions
”),
and (ii) any other limitation or restriction on transfer 
created by applicable laws. 
In addition to the foregoing
limitations on transfer, Purchaser shall not assign, encumber or dispose of any interest in the Shares while the
Shares are subject to the Company’s Repurchase Option (as defined below).
(
a
)
 
​No Transfer Without Consent​
.
 
No Shares of the Company may be transferred, conveyed,
encumbered or otherwise disposed of in any way without the consent of a majority of the Board of
Directors. 
Any purported transfer, conveyance, encumbrance or other disposition attempted without such
consent shall be null and void.
(
b
)
 
​Repurchase Option; Vesting​
.
(
i
).
 
In the event of the voluntary or involuntary termination of Purchaser’s Continuous Service
Status (as defined below) for any reason (including, without limitation, resignation, death or
Disability (as defined below)), with or without cause, the Company shall upon the date of such
termination (the “Termination Date”) have an irrevocable, exclusive option (the “Repurchase
Option”) for a period of 3 months from such date to repurchase all or any portion of the Unvested
Shares (as defined below) held by Purchaser as of the Termination Date at the original purchase
price per Share (adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends and the like) specified in Section 1.
As used in this Agreement, “Unvested Shares” means Shares, if any, that have not yet been released
from the Repurchase Option.
(
ii
).
 
Unless the Company notifies Purchaser within 3 months from the Termination Date that it

does not intend to exercise its Repurchase Option with respect to some or all of the Unvested
Shares, the Repurchase Option shall be deemed automatically exercised by the Company as of the
end of such 3-month period following such Termination Date, provided that the Company may
notify Purchaser that it is exercising its Repurchase Option as of a date prior to the end of such 3-
month period. Unless Purchaser is otherwise notified by the Company pursuant to the preceding
sentence that the Company does not intend to exercise its Repurchase Option as to some or all of the
Unvested Shares, execution of this Agreement by Purchaser constitutes written notice to Purchaser
of the Company’s intention to exercise its Repurchase Option with respect to all Unvested Shares to
which such Repurchase Option applies. The Company, at its choice, may satisfy its payment
obligation to Purchaser with respect to exercise of the Repurchase Option by either (A) delivering a
check to Purchaser in the amount of the purchase price for the Unvested Shares being repurchased,
or (B) in the event Purchaser is indebted to the Company, canceling an amount of such indebtedness
equal to the purchase price for the Unvested Shares being repurchased, or (C) by a combination of
(A) and (B) so that the combined payment and cancellation of indebtedness equals such purchase
price. In the event of any deemed automatic exercise of the Repurchase Option pursuant to this
Section 3(b)(ii) in which Purchaser is indebted to the Company, such indebtedness equal to the
purchase price of the Unvested Shares being repurchased shall be deemed automatically canceled as
of the end of the 3-month period following the Termination Date unless the Company otherwise
satisfies its payment obligations. As a result of any repurchase of Unvested Shares pursuant to this
Section 3(b), the Company shall become the legal and beneficial owner of the Unvested Shares
being repurchased and shall have all rights and interest therein or related thereto, and the Company
shall have the right to transfer to its own name the number of Unvested Shares being repurchased by
the Company, without further action by Purchaser.
(
iii
).
 
100% of the Shares shall initially be subject to the Repurchase Option (the “Vesting
Shares”). 25% of the Vesting Shares shall be released from the Repurchase Option on January 7,
2025, and an additional 1/48th of the Vesting Shares shall be released from the Repurchase Option
on the corresponding day of each month thereafter (and if there is no corresponding day, the last
day of the month), until all Vesting Shares are released from the Repurchase Option; provided,
however, that such scheduled releases from the Repurchase Option shall immediately cease as of
the Termination Date. Fractional shares shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share.
(
iv
).
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser is terminated without 
Cause (as defined
below) by the Company (or a successor, if appropriate) or resigns for Good Reason 
(as defined
below) in connection with or within 12 months following the consummation of a Change of 
Control
(as defined below), then the vesting of the Unvested Shares shall accelerate such that the
Repurchase 
Option in Section 3(b) shall lapse as to 100% of the Unvested Shares. The lapse of the
Repurchase Option 
provided for in the previous sentence shall occur immediately prior to the
Termination Date. In the 
case of a sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets other than
to an Excluded Entity, 
if the acquirer of the Company’s assets does not agree to assume this
Agreement, or to substitute an 
equivalent award or right for this Agreement, and Purchaser transfers
Purchaser’s employment to such 
acquirer in connection with such asset sale transaction, then any
acceleration of vesting that would 
otherwise occur upon Purchaser’s termination shall occur
immediately prior to, and contingent upon, 
the consummation of such asset sale transaction. As
used in this Agreement, “Change of Control” means 
(1) a sale of all or substantially all of the
Company’s assets other than to an Excluded Entity (as 
defined below), (2) a merger, consolidation
or other capital reorganization or business combination 
transaction of the Company with or into
another corporation, limited liability company or other entity 
other than an Excluded Entity, or (3)
the consummation of a transaction, or series of related 
transactions, in which any “person” (as such
term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange 
Act) becomes the “beneficial owner” (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act), directly or 
indirectly, of all of the Company’s then
outstanding voting securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
a transaction shall not constitute a
Change of Control if its purpose is to (A) change the 
jurisdiction of the Company’s incorporation,
(B) create a holding company that will be owned in 
substantially the same proportions by the
persons who hold the Company’s securities immediately before 
such transaction, or (C) obtain
funding for the Company in a financing that is approved by the 
Company’s Board of Directors. An

“Excluded Entity” means a corporation, limited liability company or 
other entity of which the
holders of voting capital stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior 
to such transaction
are the direct or indirect holders of voting securities representing at least a 
majority of the votes
entitled to be cast by all of such corporation’s, limited liability company’s or 
other entity’s voting
securities outstanding immediately after such transaction. As used in this 
Agreement, “Cause” for
the Company (or a successor, if appropriate) to terminate Purchaser’s 
employment shall exist under
the following conditions (I) Purchaser’s willful and continued failure to 
substantially perform
Purchaser’s duties to the Company after there has been delivered to Purchaser by 
the Company’s
Board of Directors a written demand for substantial performance and opportunity to cure 
which sets
forth in detail the specific respects in which the Company’s Board of Directors believes 
that
Purchaser has not substantially performed Purchaser’s duties; (II) Purchaser having committed
willful fraud, willful misconduct, dishonesty or other intentional action in any such case which is
materially injurious to the Company; (III) Purchaser’s having been convicted of, or having plead
guilty or nolo contendere to, any crime that results in, or is reasonably expected to result in 
material
harm to the business or reputation of the Company; or (IV) Purchaser’s material breach of any
material written agreement between Purchaser and the Company (including without limitation
Purchaser’s 
Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement with the Company) and
Purchaser’s failure 
to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice thereof. For
purposes of clarity, a 
termination without “Cause” does not include any termination that occurs as a
result of Purchaser’s 
death or Disability. The determination as to whether Purchaser’s Continuous
Service Status has been 
terminated for Cause shall be made in good faith by the Company and shall
be final and binding on 
Purchaser. The foregoing definition does not in any way limit the
Company’s ability to terminate 
Purchaser’s employment or consulting relationship at any time, and
the term “Company” will be 
interpreted to include any Subsidiary, Parent, Affiliate, or any
successor thereto, if appropriate. As 
used in this Agreement, “Good Reason” will mean Purchaser’s
resignation due to the occurrence of any 
of the following conditions which occurs without
Purchaser’s written consent, provided that the 
requirements regarding advance notice and an
opportunity to cure set forth below are satisfied: (1) a 
reduction of Purchaser’s then current base
salary by 10% or more unless such reduction is part of a 
generalized salary reduction affecting
similarly situated employees; (2) a change in Purchaser’s 
position with the Company that materially
reduces Purchaser’s duties, level of authority or 
responsibility; or (3) the Company conditions
Purchaser’s continued service with the Company on 
Purchaser’s being transferred to a site of
employment that would increase Purchaser’s one-way commute 
by more than 35 miles from
Purchaser’s then principal residence. In order for Purchaser to resign for 
Good Reason, Purchaser
must provide written notice to the Company of the existence of the Good Reason 
condition within
60 days of the initial existence of such Good Reason condition. Upon receipt of such 
notice, the
Company will have 30 days during which it may remedy the Good Reason condition and not be
required to provide for the vesting acceleration described herein as a result of such proposed
resignation. If the Good Reason condition is not remedied within such 30-day period, Purchaser
may 
resign based on the Good Reason condition specified in the notice effective no later than 30
days 
following the expiration of the 30-day cure period. If Purchaser is a Director but not an
Employee or 
Consultant of the Company (or a successor, if appropriate) at the time of
consummation of the Change 
of Control and Purchaser is removed from, or is not reelected to, the
Board of Directors of the 
Company (or a successor, as appropriate) in connection with or following
the consummation of a Change 
of Control, the vesting of any Unvested Shares shall accelerate such
that the Repurchase Option shall 
lapse to the same extent as if Purchaser had been terminated
without Cause as described above.

​Transfer Restrictions; Right of First Refusal​
.
 
Before any Shares held by Purchaser or any
transferee of Purchaser (either being sometimes referred to herein as the “
Holder
”) may be sold or
otherwise transferred (including transfer by gift or operation of law), the Company shall first, to the
extent the Company’s approval is required by any applicable Transfer Restriction, have the right to
approve such sale or transfer, in full or in part, and shall then have the right to purchase all or any part of
the Shares proposed to be sold or transferred, in each case, in its sole and absolute discretion (the “
Right
of First Refusal
”). If the Holder would like to sell or transfer any Shares, the Holder must provide the
Company or its assignee(s) with a Notice (as defined below) requesting approval to sell or transfer the

Shares and offering the Company or its assignee(s) a Right of First Refusal on the same terms and
conditions set forth in this Section 3(c). The Company may either (1) exercise its Right of First Refusal in
full or in part and purchase such Shares pursuant to this Section 3(c), (2) decline to exercise its Right of
First Refusal in full or in part and permit the transfer of such Shares to the Proposed Transferee (as
defined below) in full or in part or (3) decline to exercise its Right of First Refusal in full or in part and, to
the extent the Company’s approval is required by any applicable Transfer Restriction, decline the request
to sell or transfer the Shares in full or in part.
(
i
).
 
​Notice of Proposed Transfer​
.
 
The Holder of the Shares shall deliver to the Company a
written notice (the “
Notice
”) stating: (A) the Holder’s intention to sell or otherwise transfer such
Shares; (B) the name of each proposed purchaser or other transferee (“
Proposed Transferee
”); (C)
the number of Shares to be sold or transferred to each Proposed Transferee; (D) the terms and
conditions of each proposed sale or transfer, including (without limitation) the purchase price for
such Shares (the “
Transfer Purchase Price
”); and (E) the Holder’s offer to the Company or its
assignee(s) to purchase the Shares at the Transfer Purchase Price and upon the same terms (or terms
that are no less favorable to the Company).
(
ii
).
 
​Exercise of Right of First Refusal​
.
 
At any time within 30 days after receipt of the
Notice, the Company 
and/or its assignee(s) shall deliver a written notice to the Holder indicating
whether the Company 
and/or its assignee(s) elect to permit or reject the proposed sale or transfer, in
full or in part, 
and/or elect to accept or decline the offer to purchase any or all of the Shares
proposed to be sold 
or transferred to any one or more of the Proposed Transferees, at the Transfer
Purchase Price, 
provided that if the Transfer Purchase Price consists of no legal consideration (as,
for example, in 
the case of a transfer by gift), the purchase price will be the fair market value of the
Shares as 
determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors. If the Transfer Purchase
Price includes consideration 
other than cash, the cash equivalent value of the non-cash
consideration shall be determined by the 
Company's Board of Directors in good faith.
(
iii
).
 
​Payment​
.
 
Payment of the Transfer Purchase Price shall be made, at the election of the
Company or its assignee(s), in cash (by check), by cancellation of all or a portion of any outstanding
indebtedness, or by any combination thereof within 60 days after receipt of the Notice or in the
manner and at the times set forth in the Notice.
(
iv
).
 
​Holder's Right to Transfer​
.
 
If any of the Shares proposed in the Notice to be sold or
transferred 
to a given Proposed Transferee are both (A) not purchased by the Company and/or its
assignee(s) as 
provided in this Section 3(c) and (B) approved by the Company to be sold 
or
transferred, then the Holder may sell or otherwise transfer any such Shares to the applicable
Proposed Transferee at the Transfer Purchase Price or at a higher price, provided that such sale or
other transfer is consummated within 120 days after the date of the Notice; provided that any such
sale or other transfer is also effected in accordance with the Transfer Restrictions and any
applicable laws and the Proposed Transferee agrees in writing that the Transfer Restrictions and the
provisions of this Agreement, including this Section 3 shall continue to apply to the Shares in the
hands of such Proposed Transferee. The Company, in consultation with its legal counsel, may
require 
the Holder to provide an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company
evidencing 
compliance with applicable laws. If the Shares described in the Notice are not
transferred to the 
Proposed Transferee within such period, or if the Holder proposes to change the
price or other terms 
to make them more favorable to the Proposed Transferee, a new Notice shall be
given to the Company, 
and the Company and/or its assignees shall again have the right to approve
such transfer and be 
offered the Right of First Refusal.
(
v
).
 
​Exception for Certain Family Transfers​
.
 
Anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 3(c) 
notwithstanding, the transfer of any or all of the Shares on Holder’s death by will or
intestacy to 
Holder’s Immediate Family or a trust for the benefit of Holder or Holder’s Immediate
Family shall be 
exempt from the provisions of this Section 3(c). “
Immediate Family
” as used herein
shall mean 
lineal descendant or antecedent, spouse (or spouse’s antecedents), father, mother,
brother or sister 
(or their descendants), stepchild (or their antecedents or descendants), aunt or uncle
(or their 
antecedents or descendants), brother-in-law or sister-in-law (or their antecedents or

descendants) and 
shall include adoptive relationships, or any person sharing Holder’s household
(other than a tenant or 
an employee). In such case, the transferee or other recipient shall receive and
hold the Shares so 
transferred subject to the Transfer Restrictions and the provisions of this
Agreement, including this 
Section 3, and there shall be no further transfer of such Shares except in
accordance with the terms 
of this Section 3 and the Transfer Restrictions.
(
d
)
 
​Company's Right to Purchase upon Involuntary Transfer​
.
 
In the event of any transfer by
operation of law or other involuntary 
transfer (including divorce or intestate transfer upon death, but
excluding transfer upon death by will (to any 
transferee) or a transfer to Immediate Family as set forth in
Section 3(c)(v) above) of all or a portion of 
the Shares, the Company shall have an option to purchase any
or all of the Shares transferred at the fair 
market value of the Shares on the date of transfer (as determined
by the Company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion). 
Upon such a transfer, the Holder shall
promptly notify the Secretary of the Company of such transfer. The 
right to purchase such Shares shall be
provided to the Company for a period of 30 days following receipt by 
the Company of written notice from
the Holder.
(
e
)
 
​Assignment​
.
 
The right of the Company to purchase any part of the Shares may be assigned in
whole or in part to any holder or holders of capital stock of the Company or other persons or
organizations.
(
f
)
 
​Restrictions Binding on Transferees​
.
 
All transferees of Shares or any interest therein will
receive and hold such Shares or interest subject to the Transfer Restrictions and the provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 3 
, including, insofar as applicable, the Repurchase
Option. In the event of any purchase by the Company hereunder where the Shares or interest are held by a
transferee, the transferee shall be obligated, if requested by the Company, to transfer the Shares or interest
to Purchaser for consideration equal to the amount to be paid by the Company hereunder. In the event the
Repurchase Option is deemed exercised by the Company pursuant to Section 3(b)(ii) hereof, the
Company may deem any transferee to have transferred the Shares or interest to Purchaser prior to the
purchase of the Shares by the Company, and payment of the purchase price by the Company to such
transferee shall be deemed to satisfy Purchaser’s obligation to pay such transferee for such Shares or
interest, and also to satisfy the Company’s obligation to pay Purchaser for such Shares or interest 
. Any
sale or transfer of the Shares shall be void unless the provisions of this Agreement are satisfied.
(
g
)
 
​Termination of Rights​
.
 
The transfer restrictions set forth in Section 3(c) above, the Right of
First Refusal granted the Company by Section 3(c) above and the right to repurchase the Shares in the
event of an involuntary transfer granted the Company by Section 3(d) above shall terminate upon (i) the
first sale of Common Stock of the Company to the general public pursuant to a registration statement
filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “
Securities Act
”) (other than a registration statement relating solely to the
issuance of Common Stock pursuant to a business combination or an employee incentive or benefit plan)
or (ii) any transfer or conversion of Shares made pursuant to a statutory merger or statutory consolidation
of the Company with or into another corporation or corporations if the common stock of the surviving
corporation or any direct or indirect parent corporation thereof is registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “
Exchange Act
”).
(
h
)
 
​Lock-Up Agreement​
.
 
If so requested by the Company or the underwriters in connection with
the initial public offering of the Company’s securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, Purchaser shall not sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or
otherwise dispose of any securities of the Company however or whenever acquired (except for those
being registered) without the prior written consent of the Company or such underwriters, as the case may
be, for 180 days from the effective date of the registration statement, plus such additional period, to the
extent required by FINRA rules, up to a maximum of 216 days from the effective date of the registration
statement, and Purchaser shall execute an agreement reflecting the foregoing as may be requested by the
underwriters at the time of such offering.
4
. 
​Escrow of Unvested Shares​
.
 
For purposes of facilitating the enforcement of the provisions of Section 3
above, Purchaser agrees to deliver a Stock Power in the form attached to this Agreement as 
Exhibit A
 executed

by Purchaser, in blank, and such stock certificate(s), if any, to the Secretary of the Company, or the Secretary’s
designee, to hold such Shares (and stock certificate(s), if any) and Stock Power in escrow and to take all such
actions and to effectuate all such transfers and/or releases as are required in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the Secretary of the Company, or the Secretary’s designee, is
so appointed as the escrow holder with the foregoing authorities as a material inducement to make this
Agreement and that said appointment is coupled with an interest and is accordingly irrevocable. Purchaser
agrees that said escrow holder shall not be liable to any party hereof (or to any other party). The escrow holder
may rely upon any letter, notice or other document executed by any signature purported to be genuine and may
resign at any time. Purchaser agrees that if the Secretary of the Company, or the Secretary’s designee, resigns
as escrow holder for any or no reason, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have the power to appoint a
successor to serve as escrow holder pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
5
. 
​Investment and Taxation Representations​
.
 
In connection with the purchase of the Shares, Purchaser
represents to the Company the following:
(
a
)
 
Purchaser is aware of the Company’s business affairs and financial condition and has acquired
sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire
the Shares. Purchaser is purchasing the Shares for investment for Purchaser’s own account only and not
with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any “distribution” thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act or under any applicable provision of state law. Purchaser does not have any present
intention to transfer the Shares to any other person or entity.
(
b
)
 
Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act by
reason of a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona
fide nature of Purchaser’s investment intent as expressed herein.
(
c
)
 
Purchaser further acknowledges and understands that the securities must be held indefinitely
unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is
available. Purchaser further acknowledges and understands that the Company is under no obligation to
register the securities.
(
d
)
 
Purchaser is familiar with the provisions of Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act,
which, in substance, permits limited public resale of “restricted securities” acquired, directly or indirectly,
from the issuer of the securities (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a non-public offering subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions. Purchaser understands that the Company provides no assurances as to
whether Purchaser will be able to resell any or all of the Shares pursuant to Rule 144, which rule requires,
among other things, that the Company be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, that
resales of securities take place only after the holder of the Shares has held the Shares for certain specified
time periods, and under certain circumstances, that resales of securities be limited in volume and take
place only pursuant to brokered transactions. Notwithstanding this Section 5(d), Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees to the restrictions set forth in Section 5(e) below.
(
e
)
 
Purchaser further understands that in the event all of the applicable requirements of Rule 144 are
not satisfied, registration under the Securities Act, compliance with Regulation A, or some other
registration exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 144 is not exclusive,
the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to
sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to Rule
144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is
available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective brokers who participate in
such transactions do so at their own risk.
(
f
)
 
Purchaser represents that Purchaser is not subject to any of the “Bad Actor” disqualifications
described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i) to (viii) under the Securities Act. Purchaser also agrees to notify the
Company if Purchaser becomes subject to such disqualifications after the date hereof.
(
g
)
 
Purchaser understands that Purchaser may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of
Purchaser’s purchase or disposition of the Shares. Purchaser represents that Purchaser has consulted any

tax consultants Purchaser deems advisable in connection with the purchase or disposition of the Shares
and that Purchaser is not relying on the Company for any tax advice.
(
h
)
 
If the Purchaser is not a United States person (as defined by Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)), such Purchaser hereby represents that the Purchaser
has satisfied himself or herself as to the full observance of the laws of its jurisdiction in connection with
any invitation to subscribe for the Shares or any use of this Agreement, including the legal requirements
within their jurisdiction for the purchase of the Shares, any foreign exchange restrictions applicable to
such purchase, any governmental or other consents that may need to be obtained, and the income tax and
other tax consequences, if any, that may be relevant to the purchase, holding, redemption, sale, or transfer
of the Shares. 
Such Purchaser’s subscription and payment for, and continued beneficial ownership of, the
Shares, will not violate any applicable securities or other laws of the Purchaser’s jurisdiction.

PURPORTED TRANSFER OF SHARES OF STOCK THAT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH
SUCH AGREEMENT AND THE BYLAWS OF THE COMPANY.”
(

​Stop-Transfer Notices​
.
 
Purchaser agrees that, in order to ensure compliance with the
restrictions referred to herein, the Company may issue appropriate “stop transfer” instructions to its
transfer agent, if any, and that, if the Company transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate
notations to the same effect in its own records.
(

​Refusal to Transfer​
.
 
The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any Shares

to treat as owner of such Shares or to accord the right to vote or pay dividends to any purchaser or other
transferee to whom such Shares shall have been so transferred.

to all the provisions of this Section 6, the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Company and
any amendments thereto, copies of which are on file at the principal office of the Company. A statement
of all of the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon the respective

​No Employment Rights​

Nothing in this Agreement shall affect in any manner whatsoever the right or
power of the Company, or a parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, to terminate Purchaser’s
employment or consulting relationship, for any reason, with or without cause.

. 
​Section 83(B) Election​
.
 
Purchaser understands that Section 83(a) of the Code, taxes as ordinary income
the difference between the amount paid for the Shares and the fair market value of the Shares as of the date any
restrictions on the Shares lapse. In this context, “restriction” means the right of the Company to buy back the
Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Option set 
forth in Section 3(b) of this Agreement. Purchaser understands
that Purchaser may elect to be taxed at the 
time the Shares are purchased, rather than when and as the
Repurchase Option expires, by filing an election 
under Section 83(b) (an “83(b) Election”) of the Code with the
Internal Revenue Service WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE 
DATE OF PURCHASE. Even if the fair market
value of the Shares at the time of the execution of this 
Agreement equals the amount paid for the Shares, the
election must be made to avoid income under Section 83(a) 
in the future. Purchaser understands that failure to
file such an election in a timely manner may result in 
adverse tax consequences for Purchaser. Purchaser
acknowledges that the foregoing is only a summary of the 
effect of United States federal income taxation with
respect to purchase of the Shares hereunder, does not 
purport to be complete, and is not intended or written to
be used, and cannot be used, for the purposes of 
avoiding taxpayer penalties. Purchaser further acknowledges
that the Company has directed Purchaser to seek 
independent advice regarding the applicable provisions of the
Code, the income tax laws of any municipality, 
state or foreign country in which Purchaser may reside, and the
tax consequences of Purchaser’s death, and 
Purchaser has consulted, and has been fully advised by, Purchaser’s
own tax advisor regarding such tax laws 
and tax consequences or has knowingly chosen not to consult such a
tax advisor. Purchaser further acknowledges 
that neither the Company nor any subsidiary or representative of
the Company has made any warranty or 
representation to Purchaser with respect to the tax consequences of
Purchaser’s purchase of the Shares or of 
the making or failure to make an 83(b) Election. PURCHASER (AND
NOT THE COMPANY, ITS AGENTS OR ANY OTHER 
PERSON) SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
FOR APPROPRIATELY FILING SUCH FORM WITH THE IRS, EVEN IF PURCHASER 
REQUESTS THE
COMPANY, ITS AGENTS OR ANY OTHER PERSON MAKE THIS FILING ON PURCHASER’S
BEHALF. If Purchaser 
decides to make an 83(b) Election, a sample form and instructions for how file the
83(b) Election (to be 
completed by Purchaser) can be found at the following URL:
